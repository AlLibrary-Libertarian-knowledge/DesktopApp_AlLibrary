# Card Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. StatCard Component Hidden Content

**Problem**: The `StatCard` component was importing CSS from the Home page module (`../../../pages/Home/Home.module.css`) instead of having its own dedicated CSS module. This created a dependency issue that could cause content to be hidden or styles to not load properly.

**Solution**:

- ✅ Created dedicated `StatCard.module.css` with complete styling
- ✅ Updated `StatCard.tsx` to import from its own CSS module
- ✅ Removed dependency on Home page CSS
- ✅ Added proper component isolation following SOLID principles

### 2. Enhanced Visual Presentation

**Improvements Made**:

- ✅ Added glassmorphism design with backdrop blur effects
- ✅ Enhanced hover animations and transitions
- ✅ Improved card type-specific color theming:
  - Documents: Blue theme (#3b82f6)
  - Peers: Green theme (#22c55e)
  - Institutions: Purple theme (#a855f7)
  - Health: Orange theme (#f59e0b)
- ✅ Added shimmer and glow effects
- ✅ Enhanced micro-animations for graphs and indicators

### 3. Accessibility Improvements

**Added Features**:

- ✅ Proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support (Enter/Space keys)
- ✅ Focus states and outline management
- ✅ Screen reader support with semantic markup
- ✅ High contrast mode support
- ✅ Reduced motion support for accessibility

### 4. Component Architecture

**Structural Improvements**:

- ✅ Removed unused Card wrapper import
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript linting errors
- ✅ Proper prop types with enhanced interface
- ✅ Click handling and event management
- ✅ Better component composition
