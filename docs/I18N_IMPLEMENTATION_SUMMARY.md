## Technical Implementation

### Translation Keys Structure

```
home.{section}.{subsection}.{item}
components.{component}.{category}.{item}
```

### Usage in Components

```typescript
// Page translations
const { t } = useTranslation('pages');
t('home.networkStatus.online');

// Component translations
const { t: tc } = useTranslation('components');
tc('button.save');
```

### Dynamic Content

```typescript
// With interpolation
t('home.accessibility.networkStatusAria', {
  status: 'online',
  peers: '89',
  health: '98%',
});
```

## Performance Considerations
